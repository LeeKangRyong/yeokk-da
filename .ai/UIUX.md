This file defines how we iterate on specs in this repo.

- Start from user problems and real scenarios before defining solutions.
- For any UI/UX decision, always include a quick mockup before asking for a choice.
- Record decisions inline in the relevant spec section.
- Keep scope at a meaningful granularity; avoid over-fragmenting features.
